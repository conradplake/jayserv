# jayserv
A web application framework for Java. 

Code was born around 2002 aiming at an easy to implement and deploy MVC style framework. The included shop demo application was testet with Tomcat web server. To run it locally on your machine, simply copy dist/jayserv.war to Tomcat's webapps folder and open your browser at http://localhost:8080/jayserv. Unfortunately, the CSS file got lost over time.

To compile, Java Servlet-API and JDOM libraries are required.
