# jayserv
A web application framework for Java. 

Code was written around 2002 aiming at an easy to implement and deploy MVC style framework. The included shop demo application was testet with Tomcat web server. To run it locally on your machine, simply copy dist/jayserv.war to Tomcat's webapps folder and open your browser at http://localhost:8080/jayserv. Please don't mind the very old-school-ish look and feel. The CSS-file has gone missing.

To compile Java Enterprise and JDOM libraries are required.

Have fun!
